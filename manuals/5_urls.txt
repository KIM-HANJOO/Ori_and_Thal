URL :

assume - project name is currently 'webnest'

1. how do django urls work ?
    > vim webnest/urls.py
    > in VIM,
        >>> urlpatterns = [
            path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        ]


2. making 'home' url, homepage of the website
    # also applied in making any urls

    > vim webnest/urls.py
    > in VIM,
        >>> urlpatterns = [
            path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
            path('', include('blog.urls')), # 'blog' model as homepage('')
        ]

    now, have to make 'blog/urls.py' file.

    > vim blog/urls.py
    > in VIM,
        >>> from django.urls import path # path is django fuction,
        >>> from . import views # views, which will be used in application
        >>>
        >>> urlpatterns = [
        >>>     path('', views.post_list, name='post_list'), # post_list (root url) : view
        >>> ]

    
    as 'post_list' is set as the root url (''), 
    when anyone to website, 'views.post_list' will be shown
    "~, name='post_list'" is the name of url ('')


3. make 'view' of the url
    'view' is the logic of application.
    [Model] -> [view] -> [Template] (site we're seeing)

    > vim blog/views.py
    > in VIM,
        >>> from django.shortcuts import render
        >>>
        >>> def post_list(requenst) :
        >>> return render(request, 'blog/post_list.html', {})

    this function will get 'request', call 'render' method, show returned 'blog/post_list.html' from render method


4. make template('blog/post_list.html') for view
    under 'blog' dir,
    > mkdir blog/templates
    > mkdir blog/templates/blog

    (rule-of-thumbs, to well find the loc of folders)
